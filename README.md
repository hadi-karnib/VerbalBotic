### Empower Speech is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native framework](https://reactnative.dev/), a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows us to develop the app for both iOS and Android using a single codebase.
  -For state management, the app utilizes [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), providing a predictable state container for managing application state, including user sessions, data, and notifications.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) a NoSQL database that efficiently manages user data, speech therapy sessions, and progress tracking.
  -Speech analysis is powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), a modern Python-based web framework, which integrates machine learning models to assess and provide personalized speech therapy feedback.
- ðŸš¨ Node.js and Express.js are used to manage backend functionalities, including user authentication, session tracking, and interaction with the AI models for speech analysis.
- User audio files and other assets are stored in AWS S3, ensuring secure and scalable file storage for the application.
